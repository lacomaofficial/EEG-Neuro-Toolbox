# EEG-Neuro-Toolbox

This toolbox is designed to analyze electroencephalography (EEG) data. The toolbox utilizes the MNE-Python library and other advanced signal-processing methods to explore brain dynamics and connectivity patterns.

This repository contains multiple tests and frameworks for EEG data analysis, feature extraction, and machine learning classification. The tests cover both intrasubject and intersubject analysis, focusing on tasks such as EEG segmentation, feature extraction, and classification using machine learning models like **XGBoost** and **Common Spatial Pattern (CSP)**.
